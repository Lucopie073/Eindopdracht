      <p>The shoe for everyone..</p>
      <p>Does cash rule everything around you? If so, then it would be wise to cop the adidas
         Yeezy Boost 350 Cream White. Returning for round two with a huge restock, the luminous colored Yeezy Boost 350 has a cream white upper,
          core white midsole, and a camouflaged “SPLY-350” branding across the stripe on the sides. These originally released in late April of
           2017 with a retail price of $220 and restocked in September of 2018.</p>

      <h2>adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Semi Frozen Yellow</h2>
      <h5>adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Semi Frozen Yellow, Sep 2, 2017</h5>

      <p>Some text..</p>
      <p>The Semi Frozen Yellow adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 was rumored as early as May of 2017-some blogs even claimed they would be mostly
        glow-in-the-dark-but it was when photos of Kanye West wearing them first surfaced on the web later in the year that confirmed the release.
         This colorway steps outside of the comfort zone of previous 350 Yeezy sneaker releases, which have remained subtle and mostly neutral primary
          colors and bright accents. The official colorway of the 'Frozen Yellow Yeezys' is actually Semi Frozen Yellow, Raw Steel and Red and features
           both of adidas pinnacle technologies, Boost cushioning and Primeknit sock-like upper. The hype for the yellow colored Yeezys was pushed to
            the roof before launch as Kanye West appeared with Kid Cudi and Takashi Murakami as 'Ye and Cudi toured the iconic artist's studio on a trip
             to Tokyo. In addition, the rumors throughout the sneaker world suggested the Frozen Yellow Yeezy would be an extremely hard to get release
             . As expected, the Semi Frozen Yellow was announced officially on November 13th, 2017 and released in limited quantities on November 18th,
              2017. Sizes of the adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Semi Frozen Yellow are available now.</p>

        <p>Some text..</p>
        <p>The Yeezy Beluga 2.0 takes Kanye West's famous adidas sneakers full circle by returning to the colors of the first adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2.
          While the original colorway featured a bright orange (officially Solar Red) stripe across the side, the 2017 release of the Yeezy Beluga
           colorway is much more subtle. This colorway utilizes the same Zebra-like stripes as the original but the SPLY-350 branding is the only
            part of the upper with a contrasted color-this time called Bold Orange. The Yeezy Beluga 2.0 nickname comes from the similarities to the
             earlier colorway but the official colorway of this adidas Yeezy release is Grey, Bold Orange, and Dark Grey. The toned down color combo made
              it an appealing shoe for the masses compared to some previous Yeezy colorways. Despite rumors suggesting an October drop, the official
               release date for the Beluga 2.0 was November 25th, 2017</p>

        <p>Adidas is back with their latest Yeezy Boost 350 V2. Fresh off the heels of NBA All-Star Weekend, these Yeezy's are nicknamed the "Zebras," and
           come in a classic white, black and red color scheme. Sporting a white-based Primeknit upper with black accents giving off a Zebra stripe vibe,
            “SPLY-350” displayed across the sides in red finished off by a translucent BOOST cushioned sole. To date they are the most limited adidas Yeezy
             release and have instantly become one of the most popular colorways. Their release date is set for February 25th, 2017. Retail is set at $220
              and they will only be available in men’s sizing, no love for infants from Yeezus this time around. On June 24th, adidas will re-release the
